### Instructions
1. Read the instructions and prompt
2. Clone repository to local machine
3. Set up tools/environment
4. Develop application
5. Commit/push changes to repository
6. Update README.md with any specific instructions for starting application

### Goal
Create a web application that allows users to find 
the **5 closest breweries** to their state's capital using the [Open Brewery API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/)

### App Features
- Dropdown to select state
- Area to display search results

### Notes
- This is a full stack assignment - there must be a frontend and backend component (you may not fetch breweries directly from the client side).
- State capital location information is provided for you in `us_state_capitals.json`.
- This should take no more than 2-3 hours.
- There is no need to deploy this, although please ensure that it can run in a local development environment.
- There is no need for a persistent data store.
- There is no need to worry about styling (css).
- Preferred tools (present in repo) are: Django (python) and React (javascript). 
You may choose to remove this boilerplate and use your own tools or any additional tools of your liking. 
If you choose to use your own tools, please provide information for starting the application.

### Getting Started
1. `yarn install` > `PORT=8001 yarn dev` | `npm run dev`
    - Also the option to run a production like env, where webpack won't watch for changes using `build`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` > `python manage.py migrate` > `python manage.py runserver`
    - Migrations are needed for the capitals and a nice bit of breweries to display on page load.

### Personal Notes
I had a lot of fun during this take-home project. I went over the recommended 3 hours because I wanted to make this
project excel, and I was able to split it up into chunks so I could give myself a break to eat and run a few errands.
I put a lot of extra work into this and I hope it shows because I really want to work for Fisherman and would love to be
a part of the team building such a unique and interesting product. This was my best attempt to show my passion for
coding while demonstrating my knowledge within a reasonable time frame.

Thank you for letting me participate, and I would wholeheartedly enjoy joining the team so please, if there is anything I can do to
help secure a spot within the team then please let me know. :heart:
